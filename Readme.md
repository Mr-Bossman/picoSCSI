# PicoSCSI

## A SD to Parallel SCSI hard drive emulator

### Board

The board design is lossely based on the BlueSCSI V1.
The RP2350 the MCU on the Raspberry PI Pico 2 is 5V tollerant meaning no level translation logic is nessasary.
Like BlueSCSI this outputs 3.3V to the bus, which is compliant with LV SCSI.

### Firmware

Coming soon will be based on ZuluSCSI-firmware
